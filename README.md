# UserID Validation
This project shows the how to perform User ID validation of the text inputed in the textfield.


Write an application with 2 screens, for iPhone in portrait only. The app must run on iOS 11+.
 
Screen #1
- 1 text field to input text + 1 login button evenly distributed in the screen in vertical orientation.
- Use the hint “Enter your ID” for the text field. 
- The ID should be made of 3 digits + anything else.
- As long as the ID is not empty but incorrect (malformed), show an error below the text edit: “Malformed login”
- Don’t show the error when the string is empty.
- Enable the login button only when the ID is right.
- If the user taps the the button, show the next screen.
 
Screen #2
- Show a simple label centered in the screen with “Hello “ followed by the login ID
 
 Write unit tests.
